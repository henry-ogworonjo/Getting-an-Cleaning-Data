
This is the  code book for the getting and cleaning data course project offered
by Coursera. The final output of the script run_analysis.R is a clean data named tidyData.txt. 
The tidy data has both identifiers and  features

The identifiers are as follows:
subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken. 

There are 6 activity levels: 
WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test



The features are:
